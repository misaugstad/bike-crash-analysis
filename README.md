This is an RStudio project that is used to predict risk of bike crashes at a given intersection in NYC. To run:

1. Open RStudio, click file->Open Project, and open the bike_analysis.Rproj file (using an RStudio project like this allows us to use relative file paths).
3. Unzip any zipped data files.
2. Open and run any R or Rmd files.
